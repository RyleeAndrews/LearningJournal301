<h1> # LJ Code 301 - Day 1 </h1>
Today was the first time I have dealt with media queries. Last night was the first time I had even known about them after the reading and today we got to put them to the test. It was really interesting to see already how much more we can do when adding queries such as media queries and jQuery. I'm really excited though for what's coming up because we learned how to dynamically set the width and height of a webpage a little bit. Almost 50% of web traffic is done on a mobile device so knowing how to make sure your page has full functionality among different screens is very vital.
